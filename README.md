# how to get started
This website is hosted with Github pages, hence why it has the domain of github.io. 
To get started, simply fork this repository. To intergrate with github pages, your repository name should be named "[USERNAME].github.io". For example, if your username is dogsarethebest, your domain would be dogsarethebest.github.io.

This website is created using:
- HTML for website building/text
- CSS for styling, backgrounds, fonts, etc.
- JavaScript for website operations.


# why is this website basic
you may be wondering why this has very minimal code/files. i do not like working with lots of files/codes for things like websites. the purpose of this website is for a profile only which is why it is very minimal.
