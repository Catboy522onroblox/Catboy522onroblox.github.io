for my website: https://catboy522onroblox.github.io/#

whole entire thing is open source, use as you wish!
pages made with html
styling with css
javascript for overall operations of the website etc

# why is this website basic
you may be wondering why this has very minimal code/files. i do not like working with lots of files/codes for things like websites. the purpose of this website is for a profile only which is why it is very minimal.
